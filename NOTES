# NOTE trait/state ideas
# - a vector.. or discrete physics trait?
#   * velocity/acceleration for angle
#   * propel/repel other objects velocity/acceleration
#   * helpers for angle_to.. objects/mouse/center
# - auto load image asset (static)
#   * or also animations.. based on the images listed (or the actions defined like moving_forward)
# - confirmation popup state
# - in game ruby debug console
# NOTE game features
# - other weapons.. laser (ray through multiple items), seeking missiles
# - energy? (some kind of trade off for firing/shields)
# - accuracy
# - other weapon drops, with limited ammo or rapid fire
# - charge beam visibility

# - use viewport vs window for bounding bullets and things
# - draw a map of viewport, with x/y dots of stuff?
# - client/server, and large viewport worlds (subspace style)
# - show ways to make horiz/vertical scroll shooters from same code
# - parlax for topdown (diff levels of stars), horiz landscape, vert landscape
# - server browser? broadcast packets/zeroconf to locate?
# - heroku master server json, proper cache tags to avoid getting new ip list
